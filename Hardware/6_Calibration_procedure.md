# Calibration procedure

The Juntek/Drok family of digital DC/DC converters are controlled ovr a 8-pin header:
They provide measurement signals for current/voltage translated into a microcontroller suitable range 0..2.1V
They get also PWM signals form the microcontroller in the same range.

The translation ratios depend on the respective DC/DC converter. Some ranges have a bias.
